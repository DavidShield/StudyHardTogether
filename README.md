* Knowledge about HTML, JavaScript and CSS
* Knowledge of [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ )
* Knowledge of using [Spring](https://spring.io/web-applications ) to create a html page
* Knowledge of using [Apache Http Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server
* Knowledge of Linux command

## Things You Need In Order to Build a Website

Cannot wait to learn all these new knowledge and how it work? Before we start, we need some preparation.

1. ### Choose a Domain

   In order to build a website, the very first thing youâ€™ll need is a domain name.

   The domain name is your website name and address. That address is used by visitors when they try to find your site through their web browsers.

   For this website, I use [google domain](https://domains.google/) to register my domain. 

   Search for "studyhardtogether", you will find a lot of available suffix.

   * You can select your favorite domain name. (Normally it is $12/year).

   * You can also choose other common used domain providers as you like. E.g.: [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/). 

   * Another good choice is using [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/) to create your new domain names which can integrate with your AWS EC2 seamlessly (We will talk about AWS EC2 later).

2. ### Website hosting

   Web hosting is a service that hosts and stores your website files (content) on a secure server that is always up and running. 

   For this website, I host it on [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/free). You can always get as many 12 months free trial as you like with different email address.
